                        <div class="job-dates">January 2018 - February 2019</div><div class="job-description">I used both traditional and modern computer vision methods, as well as traditional cues, to predict effectiveness of video advertisements in the hope of ensuring companies appeal to the largest audience possible. The cues were largely traditional (e.g. shot boundary detection and object recognition) and an ensemble of models was utilized as well. This resulted in a publication at T-PAMI.</div>

                        <div class="job-dates">August 2018 - April 2019</div><div class="job-description">Stegonography is a cousin of cryptography, where the latter hides secret information by obviously obfuscating it and the former hides it in plain sight. Traditional stegonography alters individual pixels in an image, but my goal was to alter the inherent characteristics of an image (e.g. change the color of somebody's shirt) to hide data. I did this through a toy problem of altering how a person's handwriting looks in an image. I presented this in front of a 4-person defense committee and was key to receiving my Bachelor of Philosophy degree.</div>

                        <div class="job-dates">May 2021 - Present</div><div class="job-description">I love Spotify and one of the annual hyped-up projects the company outputs is Spotify Unwrapped (<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/6-new-features-to-unwrap-in-your-spotify-2020-wrapped/">here</a>), detailing which musical artists and podcasts a user has listened to over the past year. While a neat gimmicky feature, TikTok has no existing feature. My goal is to bring this into existence by showcasing a user's most prominent sounds, most liked videos, activity, and other such details. The project is written using Python and multiple TikTok APIs on the backend with (hopefully) a ReactJS frontend.

                        <div class="job-dates">December 2019 - January 2020</div><div class="job-description">The greater goal of this project was to take text CAPTCHAs with a lot of noise, and decode them. With CAPTCHAs containing 4 characters on a 36-way supervised classification task (A-Z and 0-9 characters), a character classification model was trained to achieve 90.88% accuracy. Then, on the CAPTCHA classification task, with the help of the character model, an accuracy of 44.41% was achieved. Throughout the project, a significant amount of code was used to preprocess the code, train models, and visualize results/accuracies. A combination of both low-level traditional computer vision (for preprocessing) and modern deep learning techniques (for classification) were used to accomplish the aforementioned accuracies. The project was written using Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Scipy, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and the Python captcha library.
